## Web Development Languages Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Week 1

During the first week , I delved into the fundamentals of HTML and gained a comprehensive understanding of its core components. I learned about the importance of semantic elements, which are crucial for defining the distinct sections of a web page, thus enhancing its structure, meaning, and accessibility. I also focused on the best practices for writing HTML code, ensuring proper syntax and organization. This initial week provided me with valuable insights into various aspects of HTML, laying a strong groundwork for my future web development endeavors. 

## Week 2

In the second week , I focused on the crucial role of CSS in web design, learning how to apply it to craft visually engaging interfaces. I delved into different layout techniques such as float, flexbox, and grid, which helped me refine my styling capabilities. Additionally, I revisited the blog post page from Week 1, enhancing its design, and worked on creating a variety of components and pages. These included an accordion, carousel, hero section, tables, app layout, and pagination designs, all styled with CSS.

## Week 3

In Week 3, I developed a foundational understanding of JavaScript and grasped key concepts crucial for frontend web development. This included learning about variables, operators, functions, and loops. I applied these newly acquired skills to my project, enhancing the websiteâ€™s functionality and interactivity. This practical experience was immensely valuable, enabling me to seamlessly integrate JavaScript with my existing designs. It also boosted my ability to create dynamic and responsive web pages, significantly advancing my development skills.

## Week 4

In Week 4, I created a perfume website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project allowed users to register, browse through a variety of perfumes, and select their preferences based on categories such as fragrance family, notes, and price range. Users could view detailed information about each perfume, including reviews and ratings. Additionally, I implemented a feature where users could create personalized perfume packages or select from predefined sets. A contact section was added to enable users to reach out via LinkedIn, Facebook, or other social media platforms for inquiries or support. This comprehensive project not only enhanced my technical skills but also provided a practical application for developing user-friendly and interactive web pages.
